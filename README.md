## The Problem

Every time a Lightning Network channel is opened, the funding transaction is broadcast to the public Bitcoin blockchain. Because standard channel openings use single-funder UTXO inputs, anyone analyzing the chain can:

- Identify the exact wallet that funded the channel
- Determine channel size and funding history
- Cluster the node operator's complete financial activity over time

This is not a theoretical risk. It is an active, exploitable metadata leak that affects every Lightning node operator globally — from individuals to businesses running payment infrastructure.

```
# What chain analysis sees today when you open a Lightning channel

TXID: 0x4f2a...b201
Input:  0xYour_Wallet — 0.05 BTC  ← YOUR FUNDING SOURCE. TAGGED.
Output: Channel Funding — 0.05 BTC ← CHANNEL SIZE. VISIBLE.
Output: Change — 0.001 BTC        ← YOUR WALLET. CONFIRMED.

Result: Full node funding history deanonymized.
```

The Payjoin Dev Kit (PDK) addresses this problem for standard on-chain payments. No implementation exists for Lightning channel funding — until now.

---

## The Solution

`lightning-payjoin-kit` brings BIP-78 Payjoin coordination to the Lightning channel establishment flow. Channel openings are constructed as multi-party transactions, eliminating the single-funder heuristic that makes node funding traceable.

```
# What chain analysis sees with lightning-payjoin-kit

TXID: 0x8b3d...c442
Input:  0xParty_A — 0.03 BTC  ← Multiple funders. Who is who?
Input:  0xParty_B — 0.02 BTC  ← Cannot determine.
Output: Channel Funding — 0.05 BTC
Output: Change — scattered

Result: Standard multi-party transaction. Channel funder: unknown.
```

The privacy improvement is automatic and transparent to end users.

## Architecture

For a full technical breakdown of the coordination protocol, PSBT construction, async relay design, and security model, see:

📄 **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**

Key design decisions at a glance:

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Coordination | Async relay-based, handles offline receiver |
| Transaction format | BIP-78 Payjoin adapted for channel funding |
| UTXO selection | Multi-party input construction |
| PSBT handling | Round-trip signature coordination |
| Node integration | LDK-compatible, FFI interface for CLN/LND |
| Dependencies | Zero external dependencies in core library |

---

## Features

- **Async coordination engine** — handles the Payjoin request-response cycle even when the funding counterparty is temporarily offline
- **BIP-78 native** — implements the Payjoin standard adapted for Lightning channel contexts, not a custom protocol
- **Zero-dependency core** — the coordination library has no external dependencies beyond standard Bitcoin libraries
- **LDK integration** — first-class support for Lightning Development Kit with examples
- **PSBT round-trip** — complete Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction handling for multi-party channel funding
- **Relay mechanism** — async relay design solves the offline receiver problem that prevents naive Payjoin from working on Lightning
- **Channel size privacy** — multi-party input construction prevents single-funder heuristic detection

---

## Status

>  This library is under active development. APIs are not yet stable.

| Milestone | Status | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| M1: Async coordination engine |  In progress | Week 4 |
| M2: Channel funding integration |  Planned | Week 8 |
| M3: CLI + crates.io release |  Planned | Week 12 |

See [ROADMAP.md](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for detailed milestone breakdown.

## Quick Start

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
lightning-payjoin-kit = "0.1"
```

```rust
use lightning_payjoin_kit::{PayjoinCoordinator, ChannelFundingConfig};

// Initialize coordinator with your node's configuration
let coordinator = PayjoinCoordinator::new(ChannelFundingConfig {
    network: bitcoin::Network::Bitcoin,
    relay_url: "https://relay.payjoin.org".parse()?,
    channel_amount_sats: 1_000_000,
})?;

// Open a channel with Payjoin privacy
// The library handles async coordination automatically
let payjoin_tx = coordinator
    .build_funding_transaction(counterparty_pubkey)
    .await?;

// payjoin_tx is a valid PSBT ready for broadcast
// Channel funding origin is now private
println!("Channel funded privately: {}", payjoin_tx.txid());
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Bitcoin Core node for real chain tests (`bitcoind` in regtest mode, accessed through the optional `corepc` feature)
- Lightning implementation for real channel integration tests (LDK is the preferred embedded Rust path)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ILE-Labs/lightning-payjoin-kit
cd lightning-payjoin-kit
cargo build
cargo test
```

To compile the Bitcoin Core RPC adapter used by regtest PoC work:

```bash
cargo check --features corepc
```

To compile the LDK-facing funding reference adapter:

```bash
cargo check --features ldk
```

The `ldk` feature includes helpers for mapping `FundingGenerationReady` into a
Payjoin funding request and `FundingTxBroadcastSafe` into the commitment-safe
broadcast boundary. It also builds the manual funding payload needed for
`ChannelManager::unsafe_manual_funding_transaction_generated` and exposes a
small callback trait matching that LDK method signature. The trait is also
implemented for LDK's real `ChannelManager` type under the `ldk` feature.
`LdkFundingSession` ties those pieces into the expected funding lifecycle:
generation event, manual funding callback, and broadcast-safe event.

### Live regtest PoC

Start a local Bitcoin Core regtest node:

```bash
docker compose up -d bitcoind
```

Then run the ignored integration test that mines funds, creates two peer inputs,
builds the collaborative funding transaction, hands it through the Lightning
funding boundary, broadcasts it through `corepc`, and mines it into a regtest
block:

```bash
cargo test --features corepc --test corepc_regtest -- --ignored
```

The same live test can be compiled against the LDK adapter surface:

```bash
cargo test --features corepc,ldk --test corepc_regtest -- --ignored
```

The two-node LDK harness is compiled behind `ldk-test-utils` and runs LDK's
real `ChannelManager` funding flow with a collaborative funding transaction:

```bash
cargo test --features ldk-test-utils --test ldk_two_node_harness -- --ignored
```

The test defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:18443` with RPC credentials
`lpk` / `lpk`. Override them with `LPK_COREPC_URL`, `LPK_COREPC_USER`, and
`LPK_COREPC_PASSWORD` if you run Bitcoin Core another way.

### Run the CLI (Milestone 3)

```bash
cargo install lightning-payjoin-kit --features cli
lightning-payjoin-kit open-channel --amount 1000000 --peer <node_pubkey>
```

## Why This Exists

The Payjoin Dev Kit (PDK), funded by OpenSats, has successfully improved privacy for standard Bitcoin on-chain payments. `lightning-payjoin-kit` is the natural extension of that work into the second layer.

Lightning Network is now the primary payment method for millions of Bitcoin users. The on-chain footprint of their channel management deserves the same privacy treatment that Payjoin has brought to direct on-chain transactions. This library exists to close that gap.

This project is part of ILE Labs' commitment to building open-source Bitcoin infrastructure. We do not build consumer products. We build the layer that other tools depend on.
